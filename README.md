# Bikesharing
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to experiment with Tableau using a ride sharing data set. It was then manipulated to use categories like gender and user type as filters to create different types of graphs, charts, and heat maps. This project was very interesting, as it showed ways to visualize data that I would not have thought of before, like using a heat map instead of a bar chart.
## Results

This image shows that there is an extremely large proportion of people who use the bike sharing system for less than one hour. This makes sense, as most people would have their own bike if they regularly biked passed 1 hour a day. This peak occured at 5 minutes with 146,752 people logging this time.

This image shows the same trend, but distributed across the different genders. This shows that there are significantly more men who use this bike sharing system than women, and, likewise, more women use this than people who have not inputted a gender. The important thing to note is that the trends are still identical, just with less people using the service in the different genders.

This image shows a heat map for the amount of bikes used at each hour across the days of the week. The darker the color, the more bikes were used. This shows that Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from roughly 5 PM to 7 PM are the most popular, with times before 6 AM on any day have very few users.

This image shows the same trends as the previous image, but separated out into the genders. Clearly, there are far less women users, but the same heat signatures show up on that chart as well. This also made the 5 PM to 7 PM of Thursday nights much more pronounced in the men, as it has the most users in any time across any gender.

This image shows a less detailed view of the hours of the week, but a more detailed view of the days based on user type. It is clear that the highest subscribership is of men subscribers, followed by women subscribers. Overall, subsribers outnumber one-time customers tremendously, or at least the subsribers use the bikes more times, which could imply multiple times per day.

## Conclusion
The results show that men outnumber women in the bike sharing service tremendously. Additionally, subsribers tend to use the bikes much more than one-time customers. The most popular time for this company's business is between 5 PM and 7 PM. More specifically, those times on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. It is interesting to note that not all work weekdays have the same usership, which might mean that some advertising should be done about Wednesday and Friday.
